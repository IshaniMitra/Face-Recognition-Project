# Face Recognition Based Smart Attendance Monitoring & Tracking System

The system captures images and extracted the parameters such as eyes, nose, face by HOG (Histogram of
Gradient) method. 
It compares the extracted features with a pre-stored database of students or employees to match the
characteristics. 
 When it is recognized correctly, then the attendance is stored with its entering date and time in attendance excel
sheet.

# Tools & Technologies:
Python with Deep Learning, Neural Network Frameworks
Libraries Used-OpenCV(HOG), NumPy, Face Recognition
Coding IDE-VS code, PyCharm
